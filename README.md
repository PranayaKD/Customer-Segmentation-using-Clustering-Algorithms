# 🛒 Customer Segmentation using Clustering Algorithms

This project involves segmenting customers based on purchasing behavior
using the **Online Retail Dataset** from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. 
This analysis helps identify customer segments like **high-value** and **loyal customers**, 
providing insights for targeted marketing strategies. 🧠📈

---

## 📂 Project Structure

- **Dataset**: Online Retail Dataset ([UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/online+retail))
- **Features Used**:
  - `TotalSpend`: Total amount spent by the customer
  - `Frequency`: Frequency of purchases made by the customer
  - `Recency`: Days since last purchase

## 📊 Key Steps

1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**: 
   - Calculated key features: Total Spend, Frequency, and Recency.
   - Handled missing values and standardized feature scales for clustering.

2. **Feature Engineering** 🛠️:
   - Computed three primary features to understand customer purchasing patterns: **TotalSpend**, **Frequency**, and **Recency**.

3. **Clustering (K-Means)** 🚀:
   - Used the **Elbow Method** to determine the optimal number of clusters.
   - Segmented customers into distinct clusters based on purchasing behavior.

4. **Cluster Analysis** 🔍:
   - Summarized each cluster's characteristics.
   - Identified **high-value customers**, **loyal customers**, and **at-risk customers**.

5. **Visualization** 🎨:
   - Visualized segments with scatter plots, box plots, pair plots, radar charts, and heatmaps.

## 📈 Results & Insights

- **Cluster Analysis**:
  - Summarized clusters for customer insights on **spending**, **frequency**, and **recency**.
  - Segmentation insights to drive targeted marketing:
    - **High-value** clusters represent top spenders.
    - **Loyal** clusters show high purchase frequency.
    - **At-risk** clusters with low recent activity.

- **Actionable Segments**:
  - **High-value customers**: Prioritize retention strategies and exclusive offers.
  - **Loyal customers**: Encourage referrals and loyalty rewards.
  - **At-risk customers**: Design re-engagement campaigns.
